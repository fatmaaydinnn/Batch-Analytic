# Batch-Analytic

ðŸ“˜ Lab Overview
This lab follows a scenario that includes the following steps:

Exploring a Simulated Enterprise Environment:
You will work within an environment containing two different projects, two datasets, and two user accounts. You will explore how datasets are structured and how access permissions are managed.

Querying Tables in BigQuery:
You will manually explore datasets using the BigQuery user interface and identify sensitive data columns, which you will then tag accordingly.

Discovering Datasets Using Data Catalog:
You will use Data Catalog to search for existing datasets across projects and enrich them with metadata by applying tags.

Creating Tag Templates:
You will create tag templates using Data Catalog to make data assets more meaningful and enable teams to use datasets more efficiently.
